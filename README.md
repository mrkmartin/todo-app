## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Reflecting on this project, my major takeaways center around strengthening my proficiency in React. Specifically, I deepened my understanding and practical application of core React concepts, including:

- State management: I gained valuable experience in effectively utilizing state to manage dynamic data within components.
- Props: I improved my ability to pass data between components using props, facilitating efficient data flow.
- Conditional rendering: I learned to dynamically render different UI elements based on specific conditions, enhancing the application's responsiveness and user experience.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to concentrate on solidifying my understanding of more advanced React patterns. Specifically, I aim to delve deeper into:

- React Hooks: I'd like to explore advanced hook usage, beyond basic useState and useEffect, and understand how to create custom hooks for complex logic.
- Performance optimization: I want to refine my techniques for optimizing React applications, including memoization, code splitting, and efficient rendering strategies.
- Testing: I plan to dedicate more time to writing comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code robustness and maintainability.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS significantly improved my styling efficiency on this project. I found the utility-first workflow particularly helpful and will be using it going forward.
